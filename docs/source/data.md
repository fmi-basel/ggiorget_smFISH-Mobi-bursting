# Data
smFISH data was generated for cell lines from the project 'Using Live-cell Imaging to investigate Enhancer-driven Transcriptional Dynamics'. 
eGFP or MS2 were targeted with Atto565 or Atto633 probes, respectively, and cell imaged using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 equipped with a spinning disk confocal scanning unit (Yokogawa CSU W1 with Dual T2, pinhole size 50 um), VS-Homogenizer (Visitron), Z-Piezo drive (ASI) and a Plan-APOCHROMAT 100Ã— 1.40 NA oil immersion objective.
